**Title:** Multi-Cloud Networking with Alkira

**Speakers:** Ken and Miss Varemang, both part of the Alkira product management team.

**Introduction:**
- The session aims to be interactive, and viewers are encouraged to reach out with questions or feedback.
- The discussion will cover the need for multi-cloud networking, introduce the Alkira Cloud Exchange Point (CXP), and discuss how Alkira can assist with cloud migration and multi-cloud networking needs.

**Why Multi-Cloud?**
- Enterprises seek the best cloud provider for specific applications. For instance, Microsoft Active Directory might work better on Azure, while AWS might be more advanced for serverless functions like Lambda.
- Companies want to avoid vendor lock-in, a sentiment stemming from the networking days when multi-vendor strategies were sought.
- Risk management and compliance are crucial. Companies want redundancy for their applications to ensure they remain unaffected by any geographic failures of a particular cloud provider.

**Why Alkira?**
- Alkira offers a single platform for various cloud providers, abstracting the complexity of each provider.
- It complements cloud-native constructs to meet enterprise needs, leveraging these constructs to provide an enterprise-grade multi-cloud network.
- Alkira standardizes multi-cloud networks across different cloud providers and ensures consistent security architecture for on-premises and cloud environments.
- From a business perspective, Alkira offers a low barrier to entry in terms of skill set and cost, providing agility to enterprises.

**Alkira Cloud Exchange Point (CXP):**
- CXPs are globally distributed and fully connected in a mesh fashion.
- They offer flexibility, allowing enterprises to build their networks similarly to how clouds are constructed.
- CXPs are scalable and provide end-to-end visibility and governance through a point-and-click portal.

**Demonstration:**
- Ken demonstrates how to use the Alkira portal to build a multi-cloud networking fabric.
- The goal is to showcase ease of management and scalability.
- The demo topology includes three branch sites, one data center, cloud networks, and two CXPs (one on the east coast and one on the west coast).
- Ken demonstrates how to create connectors for branches and cloud networks, emphasizing the ease of use and automation capabilities, especially using tools like Terraform.

**Conclusion:**
- The video highlighted the shift towards multi-cloud networking and how Alkira facilitates this transition.
- The demonstration showcased the ease with which an enterprise can set up a multi-cloud network using Alkira's platform.
