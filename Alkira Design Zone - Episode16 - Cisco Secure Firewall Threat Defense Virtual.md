**Title:** Simplifying the Deployment of the Cisco Firewall in Cloud with Alkira

**Speakers:** 
- Hasham Malik, from Alkira's product team.
- Ahmad, Product Manager at Alkira.

**Introduction:**
- The video showcases the benefits of the partnership between Cisco and Alkira in simplifying the deployment of the Cisco firewall in the cloud.

**Challenges in Cloud Firewall Deployment:**
- Deploying firewalls in cloud environments, such as AWS, Azure, or GCP, is complex due to multiple touchpoints.
- It often requires cloud-specific knowledge and understanding of cloud limitations.
- Typically, 9 to 10 steps are involved in deploying a firewall in a native environment.

**Alkira's Solution:**
- Alkira offers an agentless, cloud-native solution that simplifies firewall deployment.
- The Alkira Cloud Exchange Point (CXP) provides end-to-end connectivity.
- Alkira's platform allows for easy scaling of firewall instances based on demand.
- The solution supports segmentation and micro-segmentation for end-to-end traffic isolation.
- Alkira integrates seamlessly with the Cisco Firewall Management Center (FMC).

**Demonstration:**
1. **Onboarding Infrastructure:** Alkira supports onboarding from on-premise sites, SD-WAN deployments, and IPsec endpoints.
2. **Cloud Connectivity:** Workloads from AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI can be onboarded onto the Alkira CXP.
3. **Firewall Deployment:** Cisco FTD can be deployed in the Alkira CXP with minimal configuration.
4. **Security Posture:** Alkira offers a full stack of security, including third-party firewall integrations.
5. **Traffic Inspection:** Alkira and Cisco FTD provide multi-layered security in the cloud. For instance, traffic from a client in a host VPC can be inspected by the Cisco FTD before reaching a server in another VPC.
6. **Internet Traffic Inspection:** Alkira's policy ensures that client traffic going to the internet is inspected by the Cisco FTD. Specific internet traffic, such as social networking and news sites, can be blocked based on configured rules.

**Conclusion:**
- Alkira and Cisco's integration simplifies the deployment and management of firewalls in the cloud.
- The solution offers seamless connectivity, security, and redundancy for multi-cloud infrastructures.
