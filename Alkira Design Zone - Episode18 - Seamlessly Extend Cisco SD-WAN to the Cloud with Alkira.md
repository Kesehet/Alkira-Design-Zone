**Title:** Simplifying the Deployment of Cisco SD-WAN in Cloud with Alkira

**Speakers:** 
- Hasham Malik, Technical Marketing Engineer at Alkira.
- Deepesh Kumar, Solutions Architect at Alkira.

**Introduction:**
- The video discusses the benefits of integrating Cisco SD-WAN with Alkira to simplify and optimize multi-cloud and SD-WAN solutions.

**Challenges in Cloud SD-WAN Deployment:**
- Deploying SD-WAN in cloud environments is complex due to different constructs in each cloud service provider.
- Challenges include managing routing, ensuring security, and handling anycast routing.

**Alkira's Solution:**
- Alkira offers a cloud-native, agentless solution that simplifies SD-WAN deployment.
- The Alkira Cloud Exchange Point (CXP) provides end-to-end connectivity.
- Alkira integrates seamlessly with Cisco SD-WAN, allowing for easy deployment and scaling.
- The solution supports segmentation, micro-segmentation, and anycast routing.

**Demonstration:**
1. **Alkira Portal Overview:** The portal shows the deployment of CXPs in different regions. The left panel allows for onboarding of on-prem sites, cloud constructs, and internet exits. The middle panel showcases the marketplace, including Cisco SD-WAN services.
2. **SD-WAN Deployment:** Cisco SD-WAN can be deployed in the Alkira CXP with minimal configuration. The service requires a cloud init file, which can be generated from Cisco SD-WAN vManage.
3. **Segmentation:** End-to-end segmentation can be extended seamlessly from the SD-WAN environment to the cloud.
4. **SD-WAN Fabric:** Depending on the SD-WAN topology (regional mesh, partial mesh, or full mesh), route preferences can be set up. This allows for seamless topology extension and cost savings on long-haul private unreleased circuits.
5. **Mergers and Acquisitions:** If a company acquires another company using a different SD-WAN vendor, both SD-WAN networks can communicate seamlessly with this integration.
6. **Routing Exchange:** Alkira ensures seamless routing exchange, whether it's a single region or multi-region deployment. Alkira also maintains traffic symmetry for firewall services, eliminating the need for manual NAT rules or specific routing configurations.

**Conclusion:**
- Alkira and Cisco SD-WAN's integration simplifies the deployment and management of SD-WAN in the cloud.
- The solution offers seamless connectivity, security, and redundancy for multi-cloud infrastructures.
